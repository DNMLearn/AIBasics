This is my hobby page on AI.  I figure it would be fun to map out a different take on how to look at AI starting with asking what is Intelligence?

The way AI was taught when I went through my learning was starting with the preceptron, linear regression, supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning etc.  This didn't make a whole lot of sense to me as it skipped asking the basic first question.  What is intelligence?  This is clearly an open question.

My favorite take so far on what is AI comes from MILA or Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute's Yoshua Bengio.  He characterizes AI as a mathematics that captures learning.  I like that as it's simple.
